It also included the 4096x4096 PNG. file texture and the PSD.file. All the objects I placed on only one texturefile (Hospitalset_TXT). 

I made all the textures by myself and I really would appreciate it if you leave a review on my object page. 

I am a Dutch student and making this objects for my portfolio.
