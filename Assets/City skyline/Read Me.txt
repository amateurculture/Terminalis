Thank you first for purchasing this asset !

Important note to begin with, this asset has just been re-hauled and upgraded for HDRP/LWRP/URP.

There is an "Outdated version" kept in this package for all the past customers who already has the asset, so nothing changes for them.

I strongly recommend you to only uses the "Latest version" since it's all compatible with SRPs.

You will find 2 .unitypackages in the "Latest version" folder. Extract the one you need according to your Scriptable Rendering Pipeline.
